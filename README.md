# Privy PII Demo

This [next.js](https://nextjs.org) app is a demo of integrating Privy using Sign-In With Ethereum for user PII data.

This demo is intended to serve as a basic example for how to integrate [privy-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@privy-io/privy-js) in the browser.

You can imagine this app as a user logging in to something like a "profile" or "settings" page to store some personal information that your app could later access to understand who your users are (beyond wallet addresses).

All user data (form fields, file uploads) in this demo are end-to-end encrypted using keys managed on your behalf by the Privy kms.

## Setup

#### Install from source

```
git clone <repo>
cd <repo>
npm install
```

#### Set up your API keys

- Copy `.env.example.local` to `.env.local`.
- Update the variables in `.env.local` with your Privy API key and secret from the Privy console.

#### Start the server.

```
npm run dev
```

#### Enjoy

Point your browser to `localhost:3005`

Sleep at night as you integrate user data in your product while handling it securely! üõåüò¥üå¥üçπ
